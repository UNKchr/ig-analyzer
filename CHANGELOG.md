# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added

- **Anti-Ban Retry Logic:** Implemented an exponential backoff system to automatically handle Instagram's HTTP 429 (Rate Limit) errors safely, preventing script crashes and reducing account block risks.
- **CSV Export:** Replaced the raw JSON export with a direct `.csv` file download, making it easier for users to view and filter results in Excel or Google Sheets.
- **Progress Bar & Real-time Tracking:** Added a visual progress bar and percentage calculation to the UI by fetching the total followers/following count on the initial GraphQL request.
- **Results Tab:** Introduced a tabbed interface in the panel to switch between "Logs" and "Results", rendering the list of non-followers directly in the UI with clickable profile links.

### Changed

- **Code Architecture:** Completely refactored the codebase using the Separation of Concerns (SoC) principle. The script is now divided into modular objects (`Utils`, `Storage`, `UI`, `API`, and `App`) inside an IIFE for better maintainability and scalability.
- **String Handling:** Switched from large template literals to standard string concatenation and array `.join('\n')` for HTML injection to prevent syntax highlighting bugs in the Tampermonkey editor.

### Fixed

- **RegEx Editor Bug:** Replaced the regular expression used for cookie extraction (`ds_user_id`) with a robust `.split()` method to fix syntax parser breakage in user script managers.

### Removed

- Dead code: Removed the unused `computeDereivedData` function.

## [1.3.3] - 2026-02-13
